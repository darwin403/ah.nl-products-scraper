Provide me a solution that I can schedule on my windows server 2012r2-64bit, SQL srv 2014

The solution will scrape all products and product images from an online shop. this shop already has a structure that should be re-used.

Solution-Goal-Work:
When scraping all products for first time, store data in database and download/store image to filesystem .
When scraping for a next time, the solution should update data in database and on filesystem when something has changed. In other words only process changes.

Only respond when you have experience.
This is not a simple html scrape.

It would be great if this could be done in classic asp/vbs otherwise any other language is good as long as it meets my requirements.
